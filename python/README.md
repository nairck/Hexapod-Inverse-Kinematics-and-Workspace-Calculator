# Python version

A cross-platform **Python + Qt** port of the Hexapod IK & Workspace Calculator. It
reproduces the original MATLAB tool's geometry, math, file formats, and workflow, and is what the
**Windows `.exe`** is built from. Use this version to run on **macOS/Linux**, to build your own
binary, or to read and modify the source.

For the full description of what the tool does (geometry, IK, workspace analysis, screenshots), see
the [main README](../README.md).

**Beyond the MATLAB feature set, this version adds:** an always-on **docked console** (drag the
window's bottom edge to extend it), **light / dark / system** colour themes, a startup **splash
screen**, a crisp **app icon** on every window, a **transparent** embedded 3D preview, **Enter =
Solve IK**, MATLAB-style greying of disabled fields, **artifact-free** structured-grid workspace
surfaces with an isometric default view, and fully **non-blocking** workspace/PNG rendering (with an
**Abort** button — no frozen windows).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11 or 3.12** recommended (3.13/3.14 may work but are less battle-tested for the
  PySide6 + VTK + PyInstaller stack).
- Dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt` (PySide6, PyVista, pyvistaqt, matplotlib,
  NumPy, SciPy; PyInstaller for building).

## Run from source

```bash
cd python
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:        .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux:  source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

On Windows, if `python`/`pip` aren't on your PATH, the `py` launcher works too: `py -m venv .venv`,
`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, `py run.py`.

The app starts from the `formdata.txt` in this folder. If that file is missing or invalid, it falls
back to built-in defaults and writes a fresh `formdata.txt` (reported on the splash and in the
console) — no blocking prompts.

## Build a standalone binary

PyInstaller is **not** a cross-compiler — build on the OS you want to target.

### Windows → single `.exe`
```bat
build_windows.bat
```
…or the equivalent single command:
```bat
py -m PyInstaller --clean --noconfirm hexapod.spec
```
Result: `dist\HexapodCalculator.exe`. A default `formdata.txt` is bundled inside; drop your own
next to the `.exe` to start from your settings.

**Build options (environment variables, no file edits needed):**

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `set HEXAPOD_ONEFILE=0` | Build a one-**folder** app (`dist\HexapodCalculator\`) that **starts much faster** and is friendlier to antivirus. The tradeoff is a folder instead of a single file. |
| `set HEXAPOD_CONSOLE=1` | Attach a console window so you can see startup output/errors (debugging). |
| `set HEXAPOD_SPLASH=0` | Disable the native bootloader splash. |

> **One-file vs one-folder:** a one-file `.exe` unpacks its whole bundle to a temp folder on *every*
> launch, which costs a few seconds of startup. A one-folder build skips that and starts almost
> instantly. Pick one-folder if startup speed matters more than shipping a single file.

### macOS → `.app`
```bash
./build_macos.sh
```
Result: `dist/HexapodCalculator.app`. First launch: right-click → **Open** to clear Gatekeeper
(the app isn't notarized).

### Linux → executable
```bash
./build_linux.sh
```
Result: `dist/HexapodCalculator`. Needs system OpenGL libraries, e.g.
`sudo apt install libgl1 libegl1 libxkbcommon0 libdbus-1-3`.

> macOS and Linux builds are provided as-is and are **currently untested** — they should work but
> may need small tweaks. Reports/PRs welcome.

## Performance

Workspace sweeps are vectorised and **chunked** (bounded memory) and run on a background thread so
the UI stays responsive and can be **Aborted** mid-run. The rendered surface is a clean
**structured-grid mesh** (no alpha-shape artifacts at any resolution). Approximate run times (a
typical laptop is a few times slower):

| Resolution | Search points | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Low    | ~0.16 M | ~2 sec  (quick preview) |
| Medium | ~1.0 M  | ~10 sec |
| High   | ~13 M   | ~2–4 min  (finest) |

The full point cloud sets the reported workspace limits; the rendered mesh is strided down for fast
drawing. The NumPy kernel is already faster than the compiled MATLAB MEX, so **you do not need to
compile any C code**. An optional C-DLL path exists — see [`native/README.md`](native/README.md).

---

## File formats (interchangeable with MATLAB)

- **`formdata.txt`** — identical to the MATLAB format (71 `tag = value` lines at 3 decimals, then
  `calculator_name = '...'`), so settings files are interchangeable between the two programs.
- **Workspace datasets** — saved as compressed **`.npz`**. The Recall/PNG dialogs can also load the
  original MATLAB **`.mat`** files (v7 via SciPy; v7.3/HDF5 needs the optional `h5py`).

## Troubleshooting

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: vtkmodules...` in the built app** — build with `hexapod.spec` (not a bare
  `pyinstaller run.py`); the spec lists the VTK hidden imports.
- **One-file exe is slow to start** — it unpacks to a temp folder on launch; use the one-folder
  build (`set HEXAPOD_ONEFILE=0`) for near-instant startup. Expected behaviour, not a bug.
- **Antivirus flags a one-file exe** — common for PyInstaller one-file builds; prefer the one-folder
  build and/or code-sign the executable.
- **A build ever hangs or crashes on launch** — a startup log is written to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HexapodCalculator\startup.log` (Windows) / `~/.HexapodCalculator/startup.log`;
  the last line tells you how far it got.
- **Use a plain venv, not conda** — conda's VTK can confuse PyInstaller.
- **"Multiple Qt bindings" build error** — build inside the `.venv` (which has only PySide6). The
  spec already excludes PyQt5/PyQt6/PySide2 to guard against a polluted global interpreter.
